# RetentionInsight

RetentionInsight is a python based solution designed to forecast customer churn with unparalleled accuracy. Leveraging powerful machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes extensive customer data to patterns and indicators leading to churn. The system employs predictive modeling technique of Logistic Regression, which is later evaluated based on AUC-ROC. The model is then cross-validated and optimized for better performance.
